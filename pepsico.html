      <h2>PepsiCo Advanced Software Engineering Job Simulation</h2>
      <p><strong>Project: Augur ‚Äì Predictive Supply Chain Dashboard</strong></p>
      <p><strong>by Harinee Anandh</strong></p>

      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>As part of the PepsiCo Advanced Software Engineering Virtual Experience Program, I worked on a simulation where I had to build a dashboard called Augur. The idea was to help supply chain managers understand how each distributor was doing and how their sales might look in the coming month.</p>

      <p>This wasn‚Äôt just a coding task. I had to think like a lead engineer ‚Äî plan how the system would be structured, break the work down into smaller parts using sprints, and make sure everything worked well together. I chose the tech stack, wrote all the code, and even deployed the final version to Azure. It really gave me a chance to build something end-to-end, on my own.</p>

      <h3>Tasks Completed</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Designed the system layout and split the frontend into clean components</li>
        <li>Wrote Agile engineering tickets and organized them into 6 sprints using Kanban</li>
        <li>Built the main dashboard using React and Chart.js</li>
        <li>Added filters, search, and CSV export so users could explore the data better</li>
        <li>Set up a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions and deployed the app to Azure</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Tools & Technologies Used</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>React ‚Äì for building the dashboard UI</li>
        <li>JavaScript (ES6+) ‚Äì for managing state, interactivity, and logic</li>
        <li>Chart.js ‚Äì for stacked bar charts and visual trend breakdowns</li>
        <li>HTML5 & CSS3 ‚Äì for layout and styling</li>
        <li>GitHub Actions ‚Äì for automatic build and deployment</li>
        <li>Azure App Service ‚Äì for hosting the app</li>
        <li>Trello-style Kanban Board ‚Äì for sprint planning</li>
        <li>VS Code ‚Äì main editor used for development</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>‚úÖ Task-by-Task Implementation</h3>

      <h4>1. System Design</h4>
      <p>I started by planning how the frontend would work. I broke it into separate components ‚Äî one for the chart, one for the filters, one for the table, and so on. I also wrote a function to figure out whether each distributor was growing, stable, or declining.</p>

      <h4>2. Agile Ticket Breakdown</h4>
      <p>I wrote out 11 detailed tickets and grouped them across 6 sprints. Each one had a user story and acceptance criteria. This helped me stay focused and move from layout to full features step by step.</p>

      <h4>3. Frontend Dashboard</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>A stacked bar chart with different status and trend combinations</li>
        <li>A table with distributor details and emoji-based trend indicators</li>
        <li>Filters to drill down by trend, status, and sales threshold</li>
        <li>A search bar and a CSV download button</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>4. Git Version Control</h4>
      <p>I worked in separate branches for each sprint and wrote clear commit messages. After testing, I merged them into the main branch.</p>

      <h4>5. CI/CD Deployment</h4>
      <p>I set up a GitHub Actions workflow that builds and deploys the app to Azure every time I push to main. It took a few tries to get right, but now it updates the live version automatically.</p>

      <h3>üîß Additional Contributions</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Wrote a trend calculation function that compares forecasts to past averages</li>
        <li>Made the chart tooltips show actual distributor names under each trend</li>
        <li>Added clean styles and transitions for better user experience</li>
        <li>Made the layout responsive so it works well on different screen sizes</li>
        <li>Kept each component modular and easy to reuse or extend</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>üìå Key Learnings</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>How to plan and deliver a full frontend project on my own</li>
        <li>How to use React effectively with multiple components and states</li>
        <li>How to build dashboards that are both functional and easy to use</li>
        <li>How to automate deployments with CI/CD</li>
        <li>How to troubleshoot layout issues and CI bugs</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>üöß Challenges & Debugging</h3>

      <h4>Chart.js + React</h4>
      <p>At first, the charts weren‚Äôt updating properly. I fixed this by adjusting how I passed props and waited for the right data before rendering.</p>

      <h4>Layout Bugs</h4>
      <p>On smaller screens, the layout broke in a few places. I used DevTools to debug and fixed the spacing and flexbox issues.</p>

      <h4>CI/CD Errors</h4>
      <p>My GitHub Actions failed at first because I didn‚Äôt point to the right build folder. Once I updated the workflow to use the dist folder, it worked fine.</p>

      <h4>Debugging Tips I Picked Up</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>Log everything when things feel off</li>
        <li>Use GitHub Action logs to understand CI failures</li>
        <li>Comment out code to isolate bugs and add things back one by one</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>üéØ Outcome</h3>
      <p>I built a fully functional and clean-looking dashboard that lets users explore distributor performance visually and in detail. It includes real data metrics, search and filter options, trend logic, and live deployment. The system is ready for real-world use and easy to expand.</p>

      <p>This project helped me grow a lot as a developer. I didn‚Äôt just build a UI ‚Äî I learned how to plan, execute, debug, and deploy something real. It‚Äôs one of the most complete engineering tasks I‚Äôve done so far, and I‚Äôm proud of the result.</p>

      <h3>üöß What I‚Äôm Working On Next</h3>
      <p>Even though the current version of the dashboard works well with mock data, I‚Äôm now building a backend using Java Spring Boot to power the dashboard with real dynamic data. My goal is to replace the static dataset with live API calls and make the dashboard fully interactive and backend-driven.</p>

      <p>I plan to create RESTful endpoints for distributor records and connect them to the frontend using async data fetching. This will also give me a chance to learn more about backend development, data modeling, and fullstack integration.</p>

      <p>Once that‚Äôs complete, I‚Äôll also look into adding sorting, pagination, and possibly user authentication in future versions.</p>
     <h3>‚ö†Ô∏è Note</h3>
     <p>This project was originally deployed to Azure Static Web Apps using CI/CD via GitHub Actions. After my Azure subscription expired, I migrated the frontend to Vercel for continuous, free hosting. The original Azure CI workflow is still retained in the repo to demonstrate my deployment experience. </p>
    <h3>üìù Personal Note</h3>
      <p>This project, from the first line of code to the final deployment ‚Äî was built and maintained solely by me, Harinee Anandh, and is done as part of the Pepsico Software Engineering Job Simulation. It reflects not only my technical skills, but my obsession with polish, my eye for UX, and my dedication to building meaningful, complete software.</p>
